# cubrid-jira-fetcher

Fetch CUBRID JIRA issues as markdown, with a cache-first lookup designed for AI agents and slash commands.

This package provides two command-line tools:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cubrid-jira-search` | Look up **one** issue. Prints markdown to stdout. Uses a local cache; fetches from JIRA only on cache miss. **Use this from agents.** |
| `cubrid-jira-fetch` | Bulk-fetch an issue **and its related issues** into a directory of markdown files. |

Uses the JIRA REST API over plain HTTP, bypassing the redirect loop that occurs when tools force-upgrade to HTTPS.

## Quick install (for AI agents)

**Use `uv tool install` — it is the right tool for this job.**

`uv tool install` installs each CLI into its own isolated environment and puts the binaries on `$PATH`, the same way `pipx` does but much faster. This is strictly better than `pip install -e .` or `pip install --user` for end users:

- ✅ No shared site-packages: the tool's deps can't break your other Python projects (and vice-versa).
- ✅ No editable / dev checkout required — `uv tool install` works straight from Git or PyPI.
- ✅ Self-healing `$PATH`: `uv tool update-shell` wires up the shim directory once.
- ✅ Easy uninstall: `uv tool uninstall cubrid-jira-fetcher`.
- ❌ `pip install -e .` is for **local development** only — it pollutes whatever Python environment happens to be active and its entry points silently break when that venv is deleted.

**One-liner** — pick whichever your environment has:

```sh
# With uv (recommended):
uv tool install git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git

# With pipx (equivalent behavior, slower):
pipx install git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git

# From a local clone:
cd cubrid-jira-fetcher && uv tool install . || pipx install .
```

After install, **both binaries are on `$PATH`**:

```sh
cubrid-jira-search --help
cubrid-jira-fetch --help
```

> Last-resort fallback (not recommended — no isolation):
> `pip install --user git+https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git`
>
> Do **not** use `pip install -e .` for installation; that mode is only appropriate when actively editing this repo's source.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.14+**
- **[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)** — used to convert Jira wiki markup to markdown

Install pandoc:
```sh
brew install pandoc          # macOS / Linuxbrew
sudo apt install pandoc      # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dnf install pandoc      # Fedora / RHEL
```

Optional dev tools:
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — faster installs, used by the `justfile`
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) — recipe runner

## Using `cubrid-jira-search` (the agent-friendly one)

Prints the issue's markdown to **stdout**. Progress messages go to stderr so piping stays clean.

```sh
cubrid-jira-search CBRD-26463
cubrid-jira-search http://jira.cubrid.org/browse/CBRD-26463
cubrid-jira-search CBRD-26463 --force         # bypass cache, re-fetch
cubrid-jira-search CBRD-26463 --no-recurse    # don't walk related issues on a miss
cubrid-jira-search CBRD-26463 --dir /tmp/jira # override cache directory
```

**What it does:**

1. Looks for `CBRD-26463*.md` in the cache directory.
2. **Cache hit** → prints it. No network.
3. **Cache miss** → fetches the issue (+ 1 level of related issues by default) into the cache, then prints it.
4. Exits non-zero if the fetch fails — callers can detect failure reliably.

### Cache directory

Resolved in this order (first match wins):

1. `--dir DIR` flag
2. `$CUBRID_JIRA_DIR` environment variable
3. `~/.local/share/cubrid-jira/issues/` (default)

**Recommended setup** — share the cache across all your tools and agents:

```sh
echo 'export CUBRID_JIRA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/cubrid-jira/issues"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Piping into an agent

```sh
cubrid-jira-search CBRD-26463 2>/dev/null | your-agent --stdin
```

The Claude Code `/jira` skill calls `cubrid-jira-search` directly — no extra configuration beyond having the binary on `$PATH`.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-d`, `--dir DIR` | `$CUBRID_JIRA_DIR` or `~/.local/share/cubrid-jira/issues/` | Cache directory |
| `--no-recurse` | — | On cache miss, only fetch the requested issue (skip related) |
| `--force` | — | Ignore the cache and re-fetch from JIRA |

---

## Using `cubrid-jira-fetch` (bulk fetch)

Saves an issue and its related issues as markdown files in a directory.

```sh
cubrid-jira-fetch CBRD-26463
cubrid-jira-fetch http://jira.cubrid.org/browse/CBRD-26463
cubrid-jira-fetch CBRD-26463 --depth 3      # walk 3 levels of related issues
cubrid-jira-fetch CBRD-26463 --force        # re-download everything
cubrid-jira-fetch CBRD-26463 --json         # raw JSON instead of markdown
cubrid-jira-fetch CBRD-26463 -d my_issues   # custom output dir
```

### Output

Each issue becomes `{output-dir}/{KEY}.md` (or `.json` with `--json`):

```
related_issues/
├── CBRD-26463.md   ← the issue you requested
├── CBRD-26584.md   ← parent
├── CBRD-26433.md   ← related
└── CBRD-26521.md   ← related
```

Each markdown file contains: title and link, a metadata table (status, priority, type, assignee, reporter, resolution, components, versions, dates), the description and comments (converted via pandoc), and a list of related issues.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-d`, `--output-dir` | `related_issues/` | Directory to save files into |
| `--depth N` | `1` | Levels of related issues to follow |
| `--no-recurse` | — | Only fetch the given issue (same as `--depth 0`) |
| `--force` | — | Re-download and overwrite already-saved files |
| `--json` | — | Save raw JSON instead of markdown |

---

## Caching behavior

Both tools share the same on-disk cache. Already-saved files are skipped on subsequent runs; related issues are still traversed so a later `--depth 2` run correctly extends a prior `--depth 1` run. Use `--force` to re-download.

A markdown file written by `cubrid-jira-fetch` is served immediately by `cubrid-jira-search` (and vice-versa) when both point at the same directory.

---

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd cubrid-jira-fetcher
uv sync              # creates .venv and installs entry points
uv run cubrid-jira-search CBRD-26463
```

Or with `just`:

```sh
just install         # uv sync
just search CBRD-26463
just fetch CBRD-26463
just fetch-deep CBRD-26463 3
just force CBRD-26463
just json CBRD-26463
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`command not found: cubrid-jira-search`** — the install dir isn't on `$PATH`. With `uv tool install`, run `uv tool update-shell`. With `pipx`, run `pipx ensurepath`. Then restart the shell.
- **`pandoc: command not found`** — install pandoc (see Prerequisites).
- **Redirect loop / HTTPS errors** — JIRA responses are expected over plain HTTP; do not force HTTPS at the proxy level.
- **Stale cache** — `cubrid-jira-search CBRD-XXXXX --force` to re-fetch a single issue; delete the cache directory to reset everything.
